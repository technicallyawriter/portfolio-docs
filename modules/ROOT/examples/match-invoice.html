  <h1>Match an invoice</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <summary>
    Automatically check for discrepancies between billed and received goods by
    matching an invoice. You can perform a <a href="#two-way-match">
    two-way match</a>) with an invoice and a PO or a <a href="three-way-match"
    if you also have a receipt.

    Once an invoice is matched, its status updates to "Matched" and a linked
    invoice is created in <b>RTFM-Industries &gt; Invoices</b>.
  </summary>
  <p>
    If discrepancies are found within your
    <a href="auto-invoice-processing-rules.htm#tolerance">configured
    tolerance limits</a>, they are automatically reconciled and the
    difference is inserted as a balancing line item on the PO. If
    discrepancies exceed your configured tolerance limits, you are
    prompted to resolve them manually.

  <h2>Location</h2>
  <p>
    You can match an invoice in two locations depending on the type
    of match you're doing:
  </p>

  <h3>Match to a PO (two-way match)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><b>Procurement &gt; POs</b></p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Match to a receipt (three-way match)</h3>
  <p><b>Procurement &gt; Receipts</b></p>

  <h2><a name="two-way-match"></a>Match an invoice to a PO</h2>
  <p>
    Create an invoice from a PO and check for discrepancies with a
    2-way match. The PO must be in <b>Sent</b> status.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock
    src="../resources/snippets/invoicing/match-invoice-to-po.flsnp"
  />

  <h2><a name="three-way-match"></a>Match an invoice to a receipt</h2>
  <p>
    Check for discrepancies with a 3-way match between an invoice, PO
    and receipt.
  </p>
  <MadCap:snippetBlock

  />

  <h2><a name="Addition"></a>Additional processing options</h2>
  <p>
    When an invoice is in the <b>To match</b> status, a user has the
    following processing options that appear above the state machine.
  </p>

  <h3>Request information</h3>
  <p>
    To request additional information regarding an invoice, click the
    <b>Request info</b> button above the status line. The point of contact
    user is notified by email as a result.
  </p>

  <h4>Provide instructions to the point of contact</h4>
    You can provide instructions for the point of contact <em>either</em>
    manually on the invoice or automatically through a configured <a href=
    "auto-invoice-processing-rules.htm">automatic invoice processing rule</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To manually provide instructions, <b>Edit</b> the invoice, update the
    "Instructions for point of contact" field and <b>Save</b>. These
    instructions and the assigned point of contact are saved in the
    <b>Invoicing processing</b> tab.
  </p>

  <h3>Unassign an invoice</h3>
  <p>
    To handle an invoice exception found while matching, assign the proper user
    to the invoice in the <b>Invoice processing</b> tab and click the
    <b>Unassign</b> button above the status line. The user assigned to the
    invoice is notified by email and the invoice's status updates to "To assign"
    for reprocessing.
