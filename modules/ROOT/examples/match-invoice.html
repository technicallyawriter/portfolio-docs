  <h1>Match a supplier invoice</h1>
  <h2 MadCap:conditions="cp.EnglishOnly">Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Automatically check for discrepancies between billed and received goods by
    matching a supplier invoice to a purchase order (<a href="#Match"
      >two-way match</a
    >) or receipt (<a href="#Match2">three-way match</a>). Once a supplier
    invoice is matched, its state updates to Matched and a read-only Linked
    invoice is created in <b>Invoicing &gt; Invoices</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If discrepancies are found within your
    <a href="AutoInvoiceProcessRules.htm#If">configured tolerance limits</a>,
    they are automatically reconciled and the difference is inserted as a
    balancing line item on the PO. If discrepancies exceed your configured
    tolerance limits, you are prompted to resolve them manually.
  </p>

  />
  <h2><a name="Match2"></a>Match a supplier invoice to a receipt</h2>

  <h2><a name="Addition"></a>Additional processing options</h2>
  <p>
    When a supplier invoice is in the <i>To match</i> state, a user has the
    following processing options that appear above the state machine.
  </p>
  <h3>Request information</h3>
  <p>
    To request additional information regarding a supplier invoice click the
    <b>Request info</b> button above the state machine. The point of contact
    user is notified by email.
  </p>
  <h4>Provide instructions to the point of contact</h4>
  <div class="note">
    <p class="note">
      <b>Note:</b> the supplier invoice must be in To match state to provide
      instructions to the point of contact.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Any active user can be assigned as a point of contact, and a default point
    of contact can be configured in <b>General Settings &gt; Invoicing</b>. You
    can provide instructions for the point of contact <em>either</em> manually
    on the invoice or automatically through a configured
    <a href="AutoInvoiceProcessRules.htm">automatic invoice processing rule</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To manually provide instructions, <b>Edit</b> the supplier invoice, type
    into the "Instructions for point of contact" field and <b>Save</b>. These
    instructions and the assigned point of contact appear in the
    <i>Invoicing processing</i> tab.
  </p>
  <h3>Unassign an invoice</h3>
  <p>
    To handle an invoice exception found while matching, assign the proper user
    to the supplier invoice in the <i>Invoice processing</i> tab and click the
    <b>Unassign</b> button above the state machine. The user assigned to the
    supplier invoice is notified by email and the supplier invoice returns to
    the To assign state for reprocessing.
