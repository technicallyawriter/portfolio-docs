Content reuse goes by different names depending on the software I'm using, but the concept remains the same. Here are a few examples.

In *MadCap Flare*, I can use a snippet to remind users where to view their user permissions, for example. This is helpful when a task requires a specific permission. If the path to this location changes, or I want to update wording in this blurb, I only need to update the snippet once.

[source,xml]
----
<MadCap:snippetBlock src="../resources/snippets/view-user-permissions.flsnp" />
----

In *Hugo*, I can create a custom shortcode with this information and reference it across the docs.

[source,markdown]
----
{{% view-user-permissions %}}
----

When writing with AsciiDoc in *Antora*, I can use the `include::` directive to display content from a partial.

[source,asciidoc]
----
\include::partial$/view-user-permissions.adoc[]
----
