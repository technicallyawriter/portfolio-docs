== Git

Whether working alone or on a team, proper version control is a must.

=== Pull requests

Before merging, I like to xref:#_testability[test] and xref:#_peer_review[peer review] my docs as part of a Pull Request. If possible, I'll deploy a [branch]`feature` or [branch]`dev` branch to a staging environment and share with internal shareholders before the release.

Here's a couple of examples to show what I mean:

=== Reviews

// testing through reviews
xref:#_subject_matter_expert_sme_review[SME] and xref:#_peer_review[peer] reviews serve as catch-all tests for what escapes linters and acceptance criteria. This is the arena for "I think this paragraph is confusing" or "I would word this differently" type of feedback. Tech writers are human after all, writing documentation for other humans, so docs should consider these subjective criteria, too. Effective tech writers must develop the ability to synthesize murky (and sometimes conflicting) feedback into clear docs.
