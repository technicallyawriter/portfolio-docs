= Reviews

Docs are best when they're collaborative. And the most fruitful collaboration often takes the form of reviews. Tech writers usually aren't the expert on the subject they're writing--for this, there's the xref:#_subject_matter_expert_sme_review[subject matter expert (SME) review]. And authors usually aren't the best editors of their own work--for this, there's the xref:#_peer_review[peer review].

Reviews might look different depending on personal preference and the software used. I've conducted reviews of plain text docs in GitHub as part of a Pull Request, as well as in exported Word docs uploaded to SharePoint with the Track Changes feature turned on.

As is the rule with all collaboration, work with others to find the best compromise.
