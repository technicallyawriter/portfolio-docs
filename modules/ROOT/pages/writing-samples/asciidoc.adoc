= AsciiDoc

I've done a lot of writing in AsciiDoc for this portfolio, so I though I'd show you how the sausage is made. The intent of this page is to demonstrate my familiarity with this powerful syntax.

NOTE: I've escaped some directives with a backslash and used literal delimiters in source code blocks to keep Antora from parsing the syntax.
