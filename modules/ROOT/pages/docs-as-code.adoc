= Docs-as-code

Modern tech writing has evolved to treat documentation like code in how it's versioned, reviewed, tested, and deployed. While I began my career watching Microsoft Word struggle with 500+ page documents, I've learned first-hand that delivering high quality documentation at scale means having high quality tools and processes.

Fortunately, there's no need to reinvent the wheel. Treat the docs like code! 

== Git

Whether working alone or on a team, proper version control is a must.

=== Feature branching

As a general rule, [branch]`main` branch always contains production-ready code. This way, you can quickly release new docs without worry of it containing unfinished work or errors that'll break your site. Feature branches off of [branch]`main` contain in-progress work for upcoming releases. I prefer to scope these feature branches at the xref:agile.adoc[Epic or Feature level] and merge completed feature docs into them. How you structure your tickets informs how you structure your branches.

.Feature branching (simple)

Branching in this way is more straight-forward the more "agile" a company's release schedule is. In other words, if a company releases a feature once it's complete, the feature branch containing the docs is simply merged to [branch]`main` come release time. However, if a company prefers a longer release runway (_cough_ waterfall! _cough_), I'll create a release branch off [branch]`main` to merge completed feature branches into.

Branching like this makes writing release notes for service packs and hotfixes simple, as these docs are just another feature branch.

=== Naming conventions

I prefer to name branches using ticket IDs, for example [branch]`feature/jira-123`. Descriptive names can become confusing, vague, or even inaccurate as development evolves. The associated ticket ID serves as a breadcrumb to the source of truth, in this case a Jira ticket. This ticket contains the most up-to-date information about the feature and is a more appropriate place for details than a branch name.

[source,bash]
----
$ git branch

* main
feature/jira-123
feature/jira-456
feature/jira-789
release/v1.1.0
hotfix/v1.0.4
----

This isn't the most alluring naming convention, but sometimes:

=== Pull requests

Before merging, I like to xref:#_testability[test] and xref:#_peer_review[peer reviewed] my docs as part of a Pull Request. If possible, I'll deploy a [branch]`feature` or [branch]`dev` branch to a staging environment and share with internal shareholders before the release.

== Content reuse

Docs-as-code encourages tech writers to borrow from the coding concept of **modular programming**. This term describes how programmers separate code into independent files depending on the purpose it serves. This approach leads to less manual work and makes managing code must easier. Why write something three or four times when you can write it once and reuse it? This is transferrable to docs, of course. 

Writing docs that are more flexible and narrowly scoped may take some initial planning, but the approach is ultimately more efficient, not to mention less of a headache to manage. Proper content reuse also creates consistency for readers, making the docs easier to read. 

Content reuse goes by different names depending on the software I'm using, but the concept remains the same. Here are a few examples. 

=== Examples depending on software

In *MadCap Flare*, I can use a snippet to remind users where to view their user permissions, for example. This is helpful when a task requires a specific permission. If the path to this location changes or I want to update wording in this blurb, I only need to update the snippet once.

[source,xml]
----
<MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/user/view-permissions.flsnp" />
----

In *Hugo*, I can create a custom shortcode that contains a helpful short description for a feature. I'll then reuse this shortcode in feature docs and as a release notes introduction.

[source,markdown]
----
{{% feature-xyz-short-desc %}}
----

When writing with AsciiDoc in *Antora*, I can use the `include::` directive to display source code from a file. This is preferable to copying and pasting it on different pages because, if this source code example changes, I only need to update the example once.

[source,asciidoc]
----
\include::example$feature-xyz.php[]
----

=== Topic typing

Another valuable content reuse technique is topic typing. At it's most general, I prefer to organize content into three basic categories: **concept**, **task**, or **reference**. 

* **Concept:** used when introducing or explaining an idea, like the overview of a complex feature.
* **Task:** used when instructing user action, like enabling a feature within a product.
* **Reference:** used when providing a large amount of scannable information, like tabular data about compatibility.

Dedicating a page to a specific topic type is enough modularity sometimes. For increased reuse potential, I can make each piece of content within a page more modular, if desired. For example:

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Topic xyz

include::topic-xyz-intro.adoc
include::topic-xyz-prerequities.adoc
include::concept-x.adoc
include::concept-y.adoc
include::concept-z.adoc
----

Regardless of how modular I go, I make sure I'm consistent in how I template these files. This consistency enables me to plug-and-play content as needed.

NOTE: Structuring content for reuse is easier to do from the start but don't feel like you have to structure _everything_ for reuse. Discuss with your team (or yourself) to determine how modular your docs should be.

== Reviews 

Docs are best when they're collaborative. And the most fruitful collaboration often takes the form of reviews. Tech writers usually aren't the expert on the subject they're writing--for this, there's the xref:#_subject_matter_expert_sme_review[subject matter expert (SME) review]. And authors usually aren't the best editors of their own work--for this, there's the xref:#_peer_review[peer review].

Reviews might look differently depending on personal preference and the software used. I've conducted reviews of plain text docs in GitHub as part of a Pull Request, as well as in exported Word docs uploaded to SharePoint with the Track Changes feature turned on.

=== Subject matter expert (SME) review

This review involves working with a SME to ensure technical accuracy, proper order of operations, and prerequisites, for example. Tight feedback loops between a tech writer and SME is ideal. As a courtesy, ask the SME how they'd prefer to handle reviews and accommodate accordingly. Some prefer a meeting while others only have time for emails or SharePoint files. Efficient use of a SME's time is crucial as experts are often called to many tasks.

Complete SME reviews before requesting peer review.

=== Peer review

Once the SME signs off on the docs, tech writers can review each other's work. Peer review considers style guide adherence, proper information architecture, consistency in tone, grammar, and usage. Always communicate feedback professionally and consider the author's feelings. This isn't a free pass for ruthless criticism. Complete this review as part of a GitHub Pull Request.

=== Feature review

Once a feature is nearing **feature complete** status, it should consider the opinion of other stakeholders (Product Management, Engineering, Professional Services, Support). This review takes into account higher-level feedback from a wider audience and serves as a jumping off point for training. You'll likely receive lots of out-of-scope feedback from this review, so create tickets in your backlog and plan accordingly. Not everything requested in this review can make the initial release.

== Testability

Tech writers don't just write the docs. They should test them too!

=== Linters

Validating documentation doesn't need to be purely subjective. Tools like link:https://vale.sh[Vale,target] deliver data around style guide adherence and readability. Vale lets you customize existing style guides and create your own rules to reflect your organization's preferences. It's a very powerful tool. 

.Updates I've made to Vale in this project
====
* removed all Readability tests other than `Readability.FleschKincaid` and `Readability.FleschReadingEase` since I prefer focusing on syllable count
* removed `Google.FirstPerson.yml` rule since first-person is okay in my portfolio
* added custom vocab list at `styles/Vocab/portfolio` with `accept.txt` file for spelling exceptions
====

NOTE: Running the `vale sync` command re-downloads any removed rules from your list of packages.

=== Acceptance criteria

Another test of documentation is to verify the writing against the ticket's acceptance criteria. This calls for clear, demonstrative acceptance criteria that can pass or fail such a test. 

Here's a couple of examples to show what I mean: 

.Bad acceptance criteria
[example]
Document feature xyz

.Good acceptance criteria
====
Documentation covering the following use-cases:

* [task] fresh install workflow for new users
* [task] upgrade workflow for existing users (USA)
* [task] upgrade workflow for existing users (UK) 
====
=== Reviews

xref:#_subject_matter_expert_sme_review[SME] and xref:#_peer_review[peer] reviews serve as the catch-all test for what escapes linters and acceptance criteria. This is the arena for "I think this paragraph is confusing" or "I would word this differently" feedback. Tech writers are human after all, writing documentation for other humans, so docs should pass these subjective criteria, too. Effective tech writers must develop the ability to synthesize murky (and sometimes conflicting) feedback into clear docs.
