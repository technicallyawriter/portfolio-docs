= Docs-as-code

Modern tech writing practices should mimic software development processes and tooling, when appropriate. This approach leads to more scalable, collaborative documentation.

== Git

Whether working alone or on a team, proper version control is a must. 

=== Feature branching

As a general rule, [branch]`master` branch should always contain production-ready code. This means that documentation for upcoming releases get worked in feature branches that are typically scoped at the xref:agile.adoc[Epic or Feature level]. 

.Feature branching (simple)

Branching in this way is more straight-forward the more "agile" a company's release cadence is. In other words, if a company releases a feature once it's complete, the feature branch containing the docs is simply merged to [branch]`main` come release time. However, if a company prefers a longer release runway (_cough_ waterfall! _cough_), I'll create a release branch off [branch]`main` to merge completed feature branches into.

Branching like this makes writing release notes for service packs and hotfixes simple, as these docs are just another feature branch.

=== Naming conventions

I prefer to name branches using ticket IDs, for example [branch]`feature/jira-123`, as descriptive names can become confusing, vague, or even inaccurate as development evolves. The associated ticket ID serves as a breadcrumb to the source of truth, in this case a Jira ticket, that contains the most up-to-date information about the feature.

[source,bash]
----
$ git branch

* main
feature/jira-123
feature/jira-456
feature/jira-789
release/v1.1.0
hotfix/v1.0.4
----

This isn't the most alluring naming convention, I'll admit. What is lost in presentation is gained in clarity, in my experience. And sometimes:

Clarity is better than cleverness

=== Pull requests

Prior to merging, docs are xref:#_testability[tested] and xref:#_peer_review[peer reviewed] as part of a Pull Request (SME review should already be completed before opening PR). Depending on the DevOps setup for docs, a [branch]`feature` or [branch]`dev` branch can be deployed to a staging environment and shared with internal shareholders prior to the release.

== Modularity

topic typing (steal from old overview page), content reuse, snippets or include directives

=== Topic typing

Whether Iâ€™m writing XHTML in MadCap Flare or AsciiDoc in a static site generator like Hugo, topic typing is a priority in my information architecture. Even when not validating against the DITA specification, I mimic the following topic types and create templates for consistency, modularity, and increased content reuse:

* **Concept:** choose this topic type when introducing a concept, such as a new feature overview.
* **Task:** choose this topic type when instructing user action, such as enabling notifications within a product.
* **Reference:** chose this topic type when providing tables and matrixes that provide lots of scannable information, like a compatibility matrix.


== Reviews 

audience, reviews (SME and peer)

plain text via GitHub PRs or as Word docs in SharePoint with track changes on.

=== Subject Matter Expert (SME) review
The tightest feedback loop should be between a SME and technical writer. This review ensures technical accuracy, proper order of operations, and prerequisites. This review can be completed prior to or as part of a GitHub Pull Request.

=== Peer review
Once the SME review is complete, other tech writers can evaluate the documentation for style guide adherence, proper information architecture, consistency in tone, grammar, and usage. This review should be completed as part of a GitHub Pull Request.

=== Feature review
Once a feature is nearing _feature complete_ status, a final review considering the opinion of key stakeholders (Product Management, Engineering, Professional Services, Support) should occur. This review will take into account higher-level feedback from a wider audience and serve as a jumping off point for training.

== Testability

Validating against style guides and readability. On a team, peer review from other tech writers has the advantage of unfamiliar eyes. This is true for editing as well as "testing" the documentation with someone who's unfamiliar with the content. Sometimes a paragraph makes sense to someone if they already understand the content. This is often not the position of the audience reading user documentation. Distance like this helps actually helps tech writers do their jobs more effectively.

Test against acceptance criteria (these need to be clear, have audience in mind, etc.). Give good and bad example of AC.
