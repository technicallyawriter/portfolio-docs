= MadCap Flare

A majority of my tech writing experience is in MadCap Flare. Single-sourcing content for multiple outputs with conditional text, targets, and TOCs is like riding a bike (a somewhat heavy bike that crashes if you change gears too quickly).

== Global project linking

say why...

== Conditional text

Add print only links.

== Snippets

how I prefer to organize...

== Global variables

Automatically global and don't need to be included on a page like in AsciiDoc `include::attributes.adoc[]` (for example)

== PDF creation and styling

managing CSS for PDF is great. single sourcing.
