= Jira & Confluence

Jira and Confluence are powerful tools, yet simple enough to use in a variety of ways. However you use them, they offer time-saving potential in a unified platform.

It's more than just a ticket board, though that's its primary use. Beyond the basics of its ticket management system, I'm a fan of its dashboards, GitHub integration, and automation.

=== Dashboards

Who doesn't like pretty pictures? All kidding aside, I start my day with Jira dashboards. I'm often stretched between multiple teams and my home page consists of dashboards and filters that show the most relevant information at-a-glance. I'll typically rely on a filter sorting tickets by deadline, project, and priority so I'm confident I'm working on the most pertinent items. Dashboards that show in-progress work often reveal log-jams in processes and help visualize if I've overcommitted.

=== Smart commits 

link:https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-smart-commits/[Smart commits] do so much unifying Jira and GitHub, and it's so simple. Just by putting the relevant ticket ID in your commit message, Jira displays your commit information on the relevant ticket. This transforms your board into a one-stop-shop for the most updated status on work. Plus, this is in line with my preferred naming conventions on Git branches--by including your ticket ID in your commit message, you can be sure you're working in the right branch. 

I'm such a fan of smart commits that I still include my ticket ID in commit messages even when not using Jira. It just makes sense!

=== Automation

Workflows often get complicated and the less time spent tinkering with tickets, the more time there is to write quality docs. Jira automation helps with this. There's basic, built-in automation like "unassigning" a ticket when it's set to Done. But more complex rules are simple to configure. For example, one of my previous roles involved working with a translator. Translation work deserved its own ticket but manually creating a new ticket with each new translation request felt daunting. Rather than do it manually, I setup Jira automation to create and link a new translation ticket if the "Needs translation?" field was "Yes." To make sure this automation rule didn't flood the translator's backlog with every single ticket regardless of status, I configured the rule to only execute when the parent ticket moved from "Review" to "Translate" status. The rule also copied relevant fields like `FixVersion` and `Due Date` to inform the translator of the priority.

Organizations that buy-in to Confluence are typically ones that value a culture of documentation. This is obviously beneficial to tech writers. When Confluence is treated as a I'm a fan of Confluence not only for its easy integration with Jira but for the culture of documentation it promotes with non-tech writers.
Integration with Jira. so simple to create Jira tickets with Confluence info and vice versa. Preferred tooling of Product Managers, which means it's a great source of truth for answering questions without having to bother SMEs. Culture of documentation saving each others time. 

=== Templates

project requirements, decision trees provide vital information that tech writers need to know.

=== Content reuse

Include Page macro. sometimes it's helpful to repeat yourself. can't expect everyone to read that one page with all the info.

=== Search

Never take a good search for granted. They're hard to get right but Atlassian's search for Jira and Confluence saves me loads of time in locating information.
