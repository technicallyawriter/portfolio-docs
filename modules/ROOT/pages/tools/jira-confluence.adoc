Jira is my preferred source of truth for the past five years. It consolidates so many time-saving features that help mitigate the inherent chaos of enterprise software development.

=== Dashboards

of course, the pretty pictures. Start my morning with a dashboard. I'm often stretched between multiple teams and Dashboards deliver the most pertitnet information to me efficiently. Deadlines, tickets ranked by priority, how many items I'm currently committed to. Identifies log-jams I wasn't aware of. Etc.

=== Ticket board 

custom columns, required workflows (enforces standards but also saves from accidental click-and drags), automation, diagrams showing workflows, releases, Epics, Features.

=== GitHub integration

smart commits.

=== Automation

list automation examples.

=== Releases

release tracking. FixVersion saves the effort of rolling every ticket up into the same parent ticket. review of Pull Requests.

== Confluence image:icons/confluence.png[Confluence logo,50,50]

I'm a fan of Confluence not only for its easy integration with Jira but for the culture of documentation it promotes with non-tech writers.
Integration with Jira. so simple to create Jira tickets with Confluence info and vice versa. Preferred tooling of Product Managers, which means it's a great source of truth for answering questions without having to bother SMEs. Culture of documentation saving each others time. 

=== Templates

project requirements, decision trees provide vital information that tech writers need to know.

=== Content reuse

Include Page macro. sometimes it's helpful to repeat yourself. can't expect everyone to read that one page with all the info.

=== Search

This one seems assumed but never take a good search for granted. Saves time in locating information.
