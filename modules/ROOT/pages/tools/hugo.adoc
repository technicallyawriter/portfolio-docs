= Hugo

image:icons/hugo.png[Hugo logo,50,50]

what I like about hugo...simpler on the surface but with a higher ceiling than MadCap as you can tap into Go language features.

Can play around with it and learn on my own time since it's open source!

== Plain text

first step into plain text static site generators.

Version control is more straight forward. Diffs are readable. Merging is less complex.

== Shortcodes

reusable and consist, easy to manage, and hide messy code in separate files.

Example: custom alerts

.layouts/shortcodes/alert.html
[source, go]
----
include::example$hugo/alert-shortcode.html[]
----

.Call alert shortcode in Markdown file
[source, markdown]
----
include::example$hugo/alert-shortcode-call.html[]
----

== Templates

More robust than MadCap Flare.

Conditional logic.

.Set "description" or "summary" parameters before default Summary value.
[source, go]
----
include::example$hugo/template-logic.html[]
----

== Front matter

Controlling metadata can help with organizing docs or grouping them, for example tags and categories. Like show in the templating example TODO: link, page parameters can overwrite default values.

=== Reuse front matter

Common use-case, for release notes.

.Reference existing Feature-xyz description for release notes
[source, markdown]
----
include::example$hugo/front-matter-reuse.html[]
----

== Extensibility

Open source community!
