= Hugo

Hugo is a powerful static site generator you can write with plain text. I feel it's simpler on the surface than Flare's messy XHTML but with a higher ceiling for configuration, since it relies upon the Go programming language.

And since it's open source, I can play around without a license and continue to experiment and learn in my free time. This is a huge advantage compared to a proprietary authoring tool like Flare.

== Plain text

Hugo was my first step away from Flare and into the world of plain text static site generators. With plain text, your source code is much easier to read. This makes version control, comparing diffs, and merging branches much less complex.

My time with Hugo taught me a hard lesson about AsciiDoc support, though. While Hugo supports AsciiDoc, it requires additional configuration to run somewhat smoothly.footnote:https://blog.arkey.fr/2020/04/23/tackling-hugo-integration-of-asciidoctor[]footnote:https://stiobhart.net/2020-04-18-hugo-asciidoctor[]Your selected theme must also consider AsciiDoc support, which many don't compared to typical Markdown flavors. This ultimately pushed to me try xref:./antora.adoc[Antora], which natively supports the AsciiDocs syntax.

== Shortcodes

reusable and consist, easy to manage, and hide messy code in separate files.

Example: custom alerts

.layouts/shortcodes/alert.html
[source, go]
----
include::example$hugo/alert-shortcode.html[]
----

.Call alert shortcode in Markdown file
[source, markdown]
----
include::example$hugo/alert-shortcode-call.html[]
----

== Templates

More robust than MadCap Flare.

Conditional logic.

.Set "description" or "summary" parameters before default Summary value.
[source, go]
----
include::example$hugo/template-logic.html[]
----

== Front matter

Controlling metadata can help with organizing docs or grouping them, for example tags and categories. Like show in the templating example TODO: link, page parameters can overwrite default values.

=== Reuse front matter

Common use-case, for release notes.

.Reference existing Feature-xyz description for release notes
[source, markdown]

include::example$hugo/front-matter-reuse.html[]

== Extensibility

Open source community!
