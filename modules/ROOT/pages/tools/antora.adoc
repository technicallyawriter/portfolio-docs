= Antora

With a tagline that claims it's a "site generator for tech writers who love writing AsciiDocs" I had to give Antora a try. In fact, it's what I wrote this portfolio with. Compared to Flare and Hugo, it stands out with how it leverages Git and AsciiDoc to scale docs with ease.

== Structured configuration

Antora's project structure is strict, which is actually a strength. It requires you to have separate repositories for your content files, build configuration, and site's theming. This compartmentalization enforces a standard where commits occur in their own context, making complex projects easier to manage. Edits to your `antora-playbook.yml`, for example, won't show up in a PR that updates feature docs. While there's a slight learning curve to adopt Antora's conventions, it's worth it to have distinct separation of concerns. 

Since Antora sources content from repo URLs, Git becomes a powerful tool in your deployment pipeline. For example, I've configured this project to deploy feature branches according to a pattern search for `'feature/*`. This search is dynamic, so if you add new feature branches following the `feature/` naming convention, they're generated in the next build. Once you delete a feature branch, it's removed.

[source,yaml]
----
content:
  sources:
  - url: https://github.com/technicallyawriter/portfolio-docs.git 
    branches: [main, 'feature/*']
----

Click the version toolbar in the lower-left corner of the screen to display the `feature-abc` and [branch]`feature-xyz` branch prerelease content (-alpha).

== Easy scaling

Want to add new projects to your docs site? Just add the Git repo to the sources block in your `antora-playbook.yml`, specify a branch, and add a `nav.adoc` file. Once configured, it's included in the next build. This "hot-swapping" of repos lets you handle sources in a single configuration file rather than as directory paths within a monolith project.

== AsciiDoc over traditional Markdown

Traditional Markdown is wonderful in its simplicity, but it's underpowered for large documentation projects. AsciiDoc is as readable as Markdown but with a much richer feature set geared toward tech writing. Two of my favorite AsciiDoc features are directives that help with content reuse and single-sourcing docs: `xref:_includes[\includes::[]]` and `xref:_conditional_directives[ifdef[]]`.

AsciiDoc is the native syntax in Antora. In fact, Antora's lead maintainer (link:https://github.com/mojavelinux[Dan Allen]) is also the Asciidoctor project lead.

=== Includes

emphasis on reuse. todo...

including a section of the file. always scared of doing it by line, so do it by "tag" if you're trying to grab a section of the page. if using tags, you'll need to filter them out, though! `\include::file-with-snippets.adoc[tag=!*]`

=== Conditional directives

emphasis on single-sourcing for different outputs. common example is for administrator and internal notes.

Single source content (and output depending on audience) with attributes that you include or exclude. This means you don't have to have two versions of the same doc--it all lives on the same page (balancing act). Can define attributes in dedicated files and source them.

The below code sample shows admonitions with conditional directives for specific audiences (`admin` and `internal`). 

[source, asciidoc]
----
== Feature xyz

Introuction to feature xyz...

\ifdef::admin[]
[IMPORTANT]
.Administrator Note
=== Admins Only

This information is relevant to system administrators.
\endif::admin[]

\ifdef::internal[]
[IMPORTANT]
.Internal Note
=== Internal Use Only

This section is meant for internal eyes only.
\endif::internal[]
----

== Versioning

Usually producing versioned docs isn't that tightly declared into your project's configuration. With Antora, it's explicitly managed within the playbook.

== AsciiDoctor-pdf for print

Antora is essentially a wrapper for AsciiDoctor with support for link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/asciidoctor-pdf[AsciiDoctor-pdf].

=== Install AsciiDoctor-pdf
```NPM
npm install asciidoctor-pdf
```

=== Custom PDF styling
Extend the default PDF theme to your liking by adjusting values in a separate YAML file.

```YAML
extends: default
base:
  font-color: #ff0000
```
