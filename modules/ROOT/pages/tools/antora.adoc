= Antora

I had to try Antora after seeing its tagline: "The multi-repository documentation site generator for tech writers who love writing in AsciiDoc." I was so please with it, I used it for this portfolio site! Compared to Flare and Hugo, it stands out with how it leverages Git and AsciiDoc to scale docs with ease.

== Structured configuration

Antora's project structure is strict, which is actually a strength. It requires you to have separate repositories for your content files, build configuration, and site's theming. This enforces a standard where commits occur in their own context, making complex projects easier to compartmentalize. Edits to your `antora-playbook.yml`, for example, won't show up in a PR that updates feature docs. While there's a slight learning curve to adopt Antora's conventions, it's worth it to have distinct separation of concerns. 

Since Antora sources content from repo URLs, Git becomes a powerful tool in your deployment pipeline. For example, I've configured this project to deploy feature branches according to a pattern search for `'feature/*`. 

.Branch pattern in playbook.yml
[source,yaml]
----
include::example$/playbook.yml[]
----

New branches with the `feature/` naming convention are generated in the next build. Deleted feature branches are removed.

Click the version toolbar in the lower-left corner of the screen to display the `feature-abc` and [branch]`feature-xyz` branch prerelease content (-alpha).

== Easy scaling

Want to add new projects to your docs site? Just add the Git repo to the sources block in your `antora-playbook.yml`, specify a branch, and add a `nav.adoc` file. Once configured, it's included in the next build. This "hot-swapping" of repos lets you handle sources in a single configuration file.

== AsciiDoc over traditional Markdown

AsciiDoc is the native syntax in Antora. In fact, Antora's lead maintainer (link:https://github.com/mojavelinux[Dan Allen]) is also the Asciidoctor project lead!

Traditional Markdown is wonderful in its simplicity, but it's underpowered for large documentation projects. AsciiDoc is as readable as Markdown but with a much richer feature set geared toward tech writing. Two of my favorite AsciiDoc features are directives that help with content reuse and single-sourcing docs, respectively: `xref:_includes[\includes::[]]` and `xref:_conditional_directives[ifdef[]]`.

=== Includes

The `\includes::` directive makes including other files a simple one-line call. This makes modular docs easy, as you can just include smaller files on a page. It's my favorite AsciiDoc feature and changes the way I organize my projects. 

Antora builds on this feature with its link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/family-directories/[family directories]. Example, attachments, images, and partials are their own "family" which means they have their own default root locations. This make sourcing specific content intuitive and predictable.

At a certain point relative paths turn ugly: `\include::../../../../../feature-xyz/modular-xyz.adoc`. With Antora's family directories, you can reference the family's root directory for a cleaner path: `\include::example$/feature-xyz/modular-xyz.adoc`.

=== Conditional directives

Conditional directives in AsciiDoc help filter content based on output. Single-sourcing your docs like this can mean differentiating online vs. print content or only showing certain content to an audience.

Here are two common examples.

.Print only content
[source, asciidoc]
----
include::example$/antora-print-only.adoc[]
----

.Admin and internal admonitions
[source, asciidoc]
----
include::example$/antora-conditional-directives.adoc[]
----

== Test directives
ifdef::admin[]
[IMPORTANT]
.Administrator note

This information is relevant to administrators.
endif::admin[]

ifdef::internal[]
[IMPORTANT]
.Internal note

This section is for internal eyes only.
endif::internal[]

To build output that includes these audiences, you can set the desired attribute in your `antora-playbook.yml` or in your terminal command: `npx antora --fetch --attribute=admin:true antora-playbook.yml`

== Versioning

Usually producing versioned docs isn't that tightly declared into your project's configuration. With Antora, it's explicitly managed within the playbook.

== AsciiDoctor-pdf for print

Antora is essentially a wrapper for AsciiDoctor with support for link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/asciidoctor-pdf[AsciiDoctor-pdf].

=== Install AsciiDoctor-pdf
```NPM
npm install asciidoctor-pdf
```

=== Custom PDF styling
Extend the default PDF theme to your liking by adjusting values in a separate YAML file.

```YAML
extends: default
base:
  font-color: #ff0000
```
