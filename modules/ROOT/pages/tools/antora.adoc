= Antora

With a tagline that claims it's a "site generator for tech writers who love writing AsciiDocs" I had to give Antora a try. In fact, it's what I wrote this portfolio with.

Actually lets you nest your `/docs/` within the software. Storing docs with the rest of the software is good. You can even make symlinks between real code files and your examples files this way.

== Separation of concerns

"For tech writers" and it shows. Antora really separates content from design from styling from build. 

I appreciate its reliance on git and the ability to scale easily. 

== AsciiDoc over traditional Markdown

Traditional Markdown is great for documentation, but as a tech writer, I prefer for the power and flexibility of AsciiDoc.

Key factors in AsciiDoc syntax (turn this list into a short paragraph and add to preceding heading) 

* as readable as Markdown
* *link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/conditionals/[conditionals,window=_blank]:* route content depending on output (for example, HTML or PDF)
* *link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/ifdef-ifndef/[directives,window=_blank]:* reuse content with the `::includes` directive and display specific content using logic with the `::ifdef`, `::ifndef`, and `::ifeval` directives

== Attributes

Works similar to how Hugo uses front matter (creates metadata).

Approach: either define at the top of the page or (if you have a lot of attributes you'd like to curate) store in an attributes folder and include for different "recipes" of audiences (admin, internal).

example attributes file: `general-attribues.adoc`, `administrator-attributes.adoc`, `internal-attributes.adoc`

Single source content (and output depending on audience). This means you don't have to have two versions of the same doc--it all lives on the same page.

== Includes

great tool. includes the whole file by default. 

including a section of the file. always scared of doing it by line, so do it by "tag" if you're trying to grab a section of the page. if using tags, you'll need to filter them out, though! `\include::file-with-snippets.adoc[tag=!*]`

== Conditional directives

include or exclude based on these attributes. use for administrator and internal notes.

balancing act in tems of organization: for smaller interspersed conditions (like an internal note), just single-source it and have all conditions display in the same doc. If this becomes challenging due to the length of the doc (and readability suffers), then determine what needs to be made more modular and separate out the file with its own attributes (and `include::` where appropriate back in the "main" doc). Keep scale in mind but don't automatically build something for infinite scaling (this introduces needless complexity). Instead, keep the topic open and try to get ahead of this as needed rather than all at once in the beginning.

----
== General Guide

This guide is intended for a general audience.
// ... general content ...

[IMPORTANT]
ifdef::admin[]
.Administrator Note
=== Admins Only

This information is relevant to system administrators.
endif::admin[]

[TIP]
ifdef::internal[]
.Internal Note
=== Internal Use Only

This section is meant for internal stakeholders.
endif::internal[]

== Versioning

Usually producing versioned docs isn't that tightly declared into your project's configuration. With Antora, it's explicitly managed within the playbook.

== AsciiDoctor-pdf for print

When outputting single-sourced AsciiDoc content into PDF format, I prefer the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/asciidoctor-pdf[AsciiDoctor-pdf] NPM package.

=== Install AsciiDoctor-pdf
```NPM
npm install asciidoctor-pdf
```

=== Custom PDF styling
Extend the default PDF theme to your liking by adjusting values in a separate YAML file.

```YAML
extends: default
base:
  font-color: #ff0000
```
