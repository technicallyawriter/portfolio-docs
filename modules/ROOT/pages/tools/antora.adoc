== AsciiDoc over traditional Markdown

Traditional Markdown is great for documentation, but as a tech writer, I prefer for the power and flexibility of AsciiDoc.

Key factors in AsciiDoc syntax (turn this into a sentence of two and add above):

* same sleakness of traditional Markdown
* *link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/conditionals/[conditionals,window=_blank]:* route content depending on output (e.g., HTML or PDF)
* *link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/ifdef-ifndef/[directives,window=_blank]:* reuse content with the `::includes` directive and display specific content using logic with the `::ifdef`, `::ifndef`, and `::ifeval` directives

== AsciiDoctor-pdf for print

When outputting single-sourced AsciiDoc content into PDF format, I prefer the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/asciidoctor-pdf[AsciiDoctor-pdf] NPM package.

=== Install AsciiDoctor-pdf
```NPM
npm install asciidoctor-pdf
```

=== Custom PDF styling
Extend the default PDF theme to your liking by adjusting values in a separate YAML file.

```YAML
extends: default
base:
  font-color: #ff0000
```
