Lint your docs, stay up to date with upstream style guide changes, and customize your own style and vocabulary to reflect your style preferences with Vale.

There's a difference between claiming to follow a style guide and actually testing against that style guide. Vale is a tool that can bridge that distance and keep your writing honest. Nobody can keep all style guide rules in their head, and with Vale, you won't have to. Vale is a command line tool at its core, but there's good plugin support in popular text editors like VS Code and Neovim.

Here's how I have Vale configured for this project. See my customizations below.

== Customizations

One of Vale's greatest strength is the ability to customize it. If your organization's style rules differ slightly from Google's, for example, Vale makes it possible to adjust rules to your liking. You can even update the rule's description text, severity, and style guide hyperlink. In the past, I've linked custom rules to the doc team's Confluence which provided a rationale for the decision.

There's a proper way to ensure your customizations aren't overwritten, though. It's not enough to remove rules you don't want to apply from a chosen style guide. Once you run `vale sync` or reinstall the app, those local changes are overwritten by the upstream source. To preserve customization, it's better to turn off specific rules in your .vale.ini file. For rules you want to keep but modify, extend them in your own custom style. You can store this configuration in version control.

[NOTE]

.gitignore for Vale

Update your `.gitignore` to filter out your specified packages. But make sure to track your custom vocab and style content. Here's how my `.gitignore` looks for this project, for example.

=== Vale configuration file 

Here's my vale configuration for this project. In general I prefer Google's style guide TODO.

.Current .vale.ini
[source, properties]
----
include::example$vale/vale.ini[]
----

You'll see I've turned off several rules at the bottom of this file that don't make sense to apply to a portfolio. For example, talking in the first person is valid in this context, so I've set `Google.FirstPerson = NO`. Declaring rule preference in the .vale.ini like this means my customizations persist across fresh installs, upgrades, and syncs that grab the latest upstream rules for my style guides.

=== Portfolio style

I get to talk in the first person since it's my portfolio. I'm also allowed to be excited with exclamation points! And, because portfolios depend upon a certain level of jargon in such a small space, I increased the FleschKincaid grade level from 8 to 9. I prefer Google's style guide to Microsoft or RedHat. Correct blend of casual (allowing contractions).

=== Vocabulary

Point of maintaining a vocab. How it works (adds terms to "exceptions" list for all rules).
