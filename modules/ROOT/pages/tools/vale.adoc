Lint your docs and enforce your style guide with Vale. Actually test your docs. Apply rules through YAML files.

Vale via terminal, VS Code, or ALE (Neovim plugin).

== Customizations

Important to keep these changes across Vale upgrades and syncs, I've created my own `portfolio` vocabulary and style guide.

=== Portfolio style

I get to talk in the first person since it's my portolio. I'm also allowed to be excited with exclamation points! And, because portfolios depend upon a certain level of jargon in such a small space, I increased the FleschKincaid grade level from 8 to 9. I prefer Google's style guide to Microsoft or RedHat. Correct blend of casual (allowing contractions).

=== Vocabulary

Point of maintaining a vocab. How it works (adds terms to "exceptions" list for all rules).
