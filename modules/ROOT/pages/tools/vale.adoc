There's a difference between claiming to follow a style guide and actually testing against that style guide. Vale is a tool that can bridge that distance and keep your writing honest. Nobody can keep all style guide rules in their head, and with Vale, you won't have to. Vale is a command line tool at its core, but there's good plugin support in popular text editors like VS Code and Neovim.

Lint your docs, stay up to date with upstream style guide changes, and customize your own style and vocabulary to reflect your style preferences.

Here's how I have Vale configured for this project. See my customizations below.

== Customizations

One of Vale's greatest strength is the ability to customize it. If your organization's style rules differ slightly from Google, for example, Vale makes it intuitive to adjust and add your own rule. You can even update the description text, adjust severity, and link out to your style guide. In the past, I've linked to the doc team's Confluence which provided a rationale for the decision.

However, there is a proper way to ensure your customizations aren't overwritten across Vale upgrades or with the [command]`vale sync` command. In the next sections, I'll explain how I preserved my customizations in this project. 

=== Vale configuration file 

Here's my vale configuration for this project. In general I prefer Google's style guide TODO.

.Current .vale.ini

include::example$vale/vale.ini[]

You'll see I've turned off several rules at the bottom of this file that don't make sense to apply to a portfolio. For example, talking in the first person is valid in this context, so I've set `Google.FirstPerson = NO`. Declaring rule preference in the .vale.ini like this means my customizations persist across fresh installs, upgrades, and syncs that grab the latest upstream rules for my style guides.

=== Portfolio style

I get to talk in the first person since it's my portolio. I'm also allowed to be excited with exclamation points! And, because portfolios depend upon a certain level of jargon in such a small space, I increased the FleschKincaid grade level from 8 to 9. I prefer Google's style guide to Microsoft or RedHat. Correct blend of casual (allowing contractions).

=== Vocabulary

Point of maintaining a vocab. How it works (adds terms to "exceptions" list for all rules).
