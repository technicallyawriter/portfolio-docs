= Git 

When you're documenting three features simultaneously, releasing a weekly service pack for bug fixes on [branch]`main`, and requesting reviews from SMEs and other tech writers, you need serious control over versioning. Git provides this and more. It's an indispensable tool for keeping docs properly versioned and organized.

On this page, I'll mention my favorite aspects of Git and list a few common uses. For an overview of how I use Git in my typical workflow, see xref:/principles/docs-as-code.adoc[Docs as code]. 

In general, I prefer to use Git from the command line, but GitHub Desktop is a helpful GUI for reviewing complex xref:#_diffs[diffs] and creating/reviewing Pull Requests. It's all Git under the hood!

== Commits

A wise developer once told me, "commit early and often." One of Git's greatest strengths is the redundancy it offers through the local/remote repository structure. Not only does this give you a local sandbox in which to work and make mistakes, but it also creates constant remote back-ups of your work with each commit [command]`push`. This is helpful, since you never know when the Blue screen of death may come.

Committing often is also great advice because it leaves a clear breadcrumb trail of your work. A descriptive commit history is helpful in case you need to xref:#_reversion[revert] a change or create a branch or tag at a specific commit.

TIP: Try to keep commits smaller and well scoped. They're easier to manage when in modular, bite-sized chunks.

== Branching

Branching with Git lets you compartmentalize work in separate locations. This is helpful whether working alone on different features or alongside other tech writers. Of course, working on feature branches frees up your [branch]`main` branch for releases whenever possible. Branches shouldn't linger around for too long, either. I prefer a feature branch to not last more than a couple of months, ideally. I'll periodically merge the latest from [branch]`main` branch into my feature branches to keep them up-to-date. This reduces the likelihood of merge conflicts later on.

Branching like this requires proper organization to keep things straight. I prefer that branch names and workflows reflect the project's ticket structure. For example, if an Epic-level ticket contains 10 child User Story tickets, I'll first create a feature branch off [branch]`main` for that Epic. Then, for each child ticket, I'll create a dedicated branch off the Epic's feature branch and merged completed worked back into it. If more than one writer needs to work the same child ticket, appending the author's initials at the end of the branch name clears things up (for example, `DOC-123-PJ`). 

TIP: Smart commits in Jira make it easy to see which branch a ticket's commits belong to.

Branching also makes automated releases of docs possible. Commits merged to [branch]`main` could kick off deployments to production, while commits merged to [branch]`dev` could deploy to a staging environment, for example.
