= Agile methodology

I'm an Agile advocate with six years of experience running Scrum and Kanban frameworks. 

My preference between these approaches depends on the context. If I'm assigned to a specific dev team also running Scrum, I think Sprints for tech writing makes sense. In this context, I can follow one sprint behind development and stay aligned with changes by attending their stand-up and planning meetings. If I'm stretched across several teams, I typically find Kanban most effective. Planning simultaneous sprints becomes too much of a task at this point. It's better to simplify the board and let release deadlines determine documentation priorities.

Above all, I believe in team-created definitions and processes that measure out bite-size chunks of work with testable acceptance criteria. Who doesn't like moving tickets from left to right across the board?! &#128522;

== Agile ceremonies

Over the past six years I have experience participating in and leading typical Agile ceremonies:

* Daily stand-up meetings
* Backlog Refinement meetings
* Sprint Planning meetings
* Retrospective meetings

If I had to choose only one, I'd pick the daily stand-ups! These quick check-ins are invaluable.

== Definition of done

Establishing a definition of done is helpful to limit scope creep in tickets. Docs can always improve, but this doesn't mean they're updated in one fell swoop. Creating a series of narrowly scoped tickets helps decouple efforts and makes collaboration easier. 

I'm a fan of the link:https://gamestorming.com/circles-and-soup/[Circles and Soup activity^] to help writers agree on a definition of done. This game maps out what tech writers can control and influence as well as what is out of their control. Knowing the difference between these categories leads to more predictable resolution times for tickets. 

== Document early and often

I'd rather involve docs earlier in the software development life cycle (SDLC) than later. The "document late" approach is generally dated, though there is such thing as documenting too early. As a general rule, once a project has stable business rules, it's time to start documenting foundational concepts and high-level processes. Then, as development irons out the nitty-gritty details, adjusting course and reviewing changes is a more straight forward process.

== Tight feedback loops

What I appreciate most about Agile is how it encourages efficient communication. 15-minute daily stand-ups and quick touch-points with SMEs provide consistent opportunities to share updates. My favorite type of feedback loop is the team retrospective. This meeting can occur after each Sprint or, less frequently, following a release milestone. Developing a cadence for feedback is largely what makes Agile such a successful approach and mindset.
