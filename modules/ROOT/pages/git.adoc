Git is great!


For an idea of how I use Git in my typical workflow, see the xref:docs-as-code[Docs as code] page. 

This page is more or less me gushing over how vital Git is for tech writers. Brief why?

I prefer the CLI but also like GitHub Desktop. It's all Git under the hood.

== Commits

early and often. breadcrumb trail of what you're working on. try to group commits so xref:#_rollbacks[rolling back] is simpler.

Linus invented it for a reason!

== Branching

todo...isolating work (from release pipeline but also other work). makes deploying pre-release docs possible. reduces merge conflicts from multiple people working on the same branch (or working straight on master!).

== Diffs

todo...helpful in comparision and reviews, especially. 

== Rollbacks

todo...

== Tags and releases

todo...
