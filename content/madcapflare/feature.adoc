== RTFM-Industries Documentation Dashboards
The following link:../../overview/#_topic_typing[concept documentation] introduces RTFM-Industries Documentation Dashboards, a splendid feature that helps tech writers do their jobs more effectively.

=== Code sample
```XHTML
<body>
    <h1>RTFM-Industries Documentation Dashboards</h1>
    <p>
        RTFM-Industries Documentation Dashboards provides technical writers with visualized data to track documentation requests. Each dashboard tracks the following metrics:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reuests for new feature documentation</li>
        <li>Request for documentation bug fixes</li>
        <li>Percentage of documentation completed per project</li>
    </ul>
    <figure>
        <img src=" ../images/best-practice-documentation-dashboards.png " alt="image of RTFM-Industries Documentation Dashboards " />
        <figcaption>RTFM-Industries Documentation Dashboards</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        Within each dashboard, a tech writer can learn more about each data point by clicking on it. Requests are color-coded to signify priority:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="red-txt">Red</span> = you forgot to write the documentation and everyone knows it
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="yellow-txt">Yellow</span> = you've successfully pushed the deadline back by pretending to be sick</li>
        <li>
          <span class="green-txt">Green</span> = you've got PLENTY of time to write the docs (as long as nothing goes wrong)
        </li>
    </ul>
        <p>To adjust these priorities, see the <a href="adjust-doc-priority.htm">Adjusting Documentation Priorities</a> section.</p>
    <h2>Export Documentation Dashboards</h2>
    <p>RTFM-Industries Dashboard tiles can be exported into the following file type: (Excel, PDF, RTF, CSV).</p>
        <p>
        <span class="note">
        <span class="bold">Note:</span>
            All RTFM-Industries Documentation Dashboards are fully HTML5 and do not require Microsoft Silverlight.
        </span>
        </p>
        <h2>Prerequisites &amp; licensing</h2>
