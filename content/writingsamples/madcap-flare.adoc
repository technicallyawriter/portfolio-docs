=== RTFM-Industries Documentation Dashboards

View feature documentation for the fictional RTFM-Industries Documentation Dashboard feature.
The following link:../../overview/#_topic_typing[concept documentation] introduces RTFM-Industries Documentation Dashboards, a splendid feature that helps tech writers do their jobs more effectively.

==== Code sample
```XHTML
<body>
    <h1>RTFM-Industries Documentation Dashboards</h1>
    <p>
        RTFM-Industries Documentation Dashboards provides technical writers with visualized data to track documentation requests. Each dashboard tracks the following metrics:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reuests for new feature documentation</li>
        <li>Request for documentation bug fixes</li>
        <li>Percentage of documentation completed per project</li>
    </ul>
    <figure>
        <img src=" ../images/best-practice-documentation-dashboards.png " alt="image of RTFM-Industries Documentation Dashboards " />
        <figcaption>RTFM-Industries Documentation Dashboards</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        Within each dashboard, a tech writer can learn more about each data point by clicking on it. Requests are color-coded to signify priority:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="red-txt">Red</span> = you forgot to write the documentation and everyone knows it
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="yellow-txt">Yellow</span> = you've successfully pushed the deadline back by pretending to be sick</li>
        <li>
          <span class="green-txt">Green</span> = you've got PLENTY of time to write the docs (as long as nothing goes wrong)
        </li>
    </ul>
        <p>To adjust these priorities, see the <a href="adjust-doc-priority.htm">Adjusting Documentation Priorities</a> section.</p>
    <h2>Export Documentation Dashboards</h2>
    <p>RTFM-Industries Dashboard tiles can be exported into the following file type: (Excel, PDF, RTF, CSV).</p>
        <p>
        <span class="note">
        <span class="bold">Note:</span>
            All RTFM-Industries Documentation Dashboards are fully HTML5 and do not require Microsoft Silverlight.

=== Create a new Documentation Dashboard

The following link:../../overview/#_topic_typing[task] instructs users how to create a new Documentation Dashboard that evaluates the effectiveness of published documentation.

==== Code sample
```XHTML
<body>
    <h1>Create a new Documentation Dashboard</h1>
    <p>The creation of a custom Documentation Dashboard helps to visualize the effectiveness of published documentation based on topic type (concept, task, reference).

        <ol>
            <li><span class="bold">Categories:</span> Allows the user to select the data categories (RTFM-Industries tables) that should be accessible on the report. One or more categories must be selected and will determine the fields that are available to select on the other tabs.
                <br /><span class="note "><span class="bold ">Note:</span> Users will see the tables they're permissioned to access.</span><br /></li>
            <li><span class="bold">Sorts:</span> Allows the user to select one or more data fields used to sort the data. This is optional</li>

== Release notes

Release notes to the fictional RTFM-Industries release (v1.1.0) are below. For many users, release notes may be their only interaction with software documentation, which makes it a unique document.

=== Code segments explained

* brief summary of major changes (1-2 sentences)
* "key highlights" list with anchor links for user navigation
* images that say 1000 words
* conditional text for online and print-only outputs

    <h1>Match a supplier invoice</h1>
    <h2 MadCap:conditions="cp.EnglishOnly">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Automatically check for discrepancies between billed and received goods by matching a supplier invoice to a purchase order (<a href="#Match">two-way match</a>) or receipt (<a href="#Match2">three-way match</a>). Once a supplier invoice is matched, its state updates to Matched and a read-only Linked invoice is created in <b>Invoicing &gt;&#160;Invoices</b>.</p>
    <p>
        If discrepancies are found within your <a href="AutoInvoiceProcessRules.htm#If">configured tolerance limits</a>, they are automatically reconciled and the difference is inserted as a balancing line item on the PO. If discrepancies exceed your configured tolerance limits, you are prompted to resolve them manually.
    </p>
    <p><b>Additional processing options</b>
    </p>
    <p>To request information or record an invoice exception, see the <a href="#Addition">Additional processing options</a> section. </p>
    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>Depending on where you are in the procure-to-pay process, you can match an invoice in the following locations:</p>
    <h3>Match to a PO (two-way match)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><b>Homepage &gt;&#160;To do &gt;&#160;Your POs to match</b>

    </ul>
    <h3>Match to a receipt (three-way match)</h3>
    <p><b>Procurement &gt;&#160;Receipts</b>
    </p>
    <h2>
        <a name="Match"></a>Match a supplier invoice to a PO</h2>
    <p>Create a supplier invoice from a PO&#160;and check for discrepancies with a 2-way match. PO must be in <i>Sent</i> state.</p>
    <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Invoicing/MatchSupplierInvoiceToPO.flsnp" />
    <h2>
        <a name="Match2"></a>Match a supplier invoice to a receipt</h2>
    <p>Check for discrepancies with a 3-way match between a supplier invoice, PO and receipt.</p>
    <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Invoicing/MatchSupplierInvoiceToReceipt.flsnp" />
    <h2>
        <a name="Addition"></a>Additional processing options</h2>
    <p>When a supplier invoice is in the <i>To match</i> state, a user has the following processing options that appear above the state machine. </p>
    <h3>Request information</h3>
    <p>To request additional information regarding a supplier invoice click the <b>Request info</b> button above the state machine. The point of contact user is notified by email. </p>
    <h4>Provide instructions to the point of contact</h4>
    <div class="note">
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> the supplier invoice must be in To match state to provide instructions to the point of contact.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Any active user can be assigned as a point of contact, and a default point of contact can be configured in <b>General Settings &gt; Invoicing</b>. You can provide instructions for the point of contact <em>either</em> manually on the invoice or automatically through a configured <a href="AutoInvoiceProcessRules.htm">automatic invoice processing rule</a>. </p>
    <p>To manually provide instructions, <b>Edit</b> the supplier invoice, type into the "Instructions for point of contact" field and <b>Save</b>. These instructions and the assigned point of contact appear in the <i>Invoicing processing</i> tab. </p>
    <h3>Unassign an invoice</h3>
    <p>To handle an invoice exception found while matching, assign the proper user to the supplier invoice in the <i>Invoice processing</i> tab and click the <b>Unassign</b> button above the state machine. The user assigned to the supplier invoice is notified by email and the supplier invoice returns to the To assign state for reprocessing. </p>
