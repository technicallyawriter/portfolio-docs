== AsciiDoctor-pdf
When outputting single-sourced AsciiDoc content into PDF format, I prefer the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/asciidoctor-pdf[AsciiDoctor-pdf] NPM package.

== Install AsciiDoctor-pdf
```NPM
npm install asciidoctor-pdf
```

== Custom PDF styling
Extend the default PDF theme to your liking by adjusting values in a separate YAML file.

```YAML
extends: default
base:
  font-color: #ff0000
```

TIP: Refer to the link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/blob/main/docs/theming-guide.adoc[AsciiDoctor PDF Theming Guide,window=_blank] for more details.
