== Agile Ceremonies
Over the past five (5) years I have experience participating in and leading typical Agile ceremonies:

* Daily stand-up meetings
* Backlog Refinement meetings
* Sprint Planning meetings
* Retrospective meetings

== Definition of Done
Establishing a Definition of Done is instrumental for negating scope creep in documentation. I'm a fan of the link:https://gamestorming.com/circles-and-soup/[Circles and Soup activity,window=_blank] to demarcate what tech writers can control and influence verses what is out of their control from an organizational standpoint.

== Document Early and Often
When possible, I advocate that tech writers be involved earlier in the software development life cycle (SDLC) rather than later. Once a project has stable business rules, it's time to start documenting foundational concepts and high-level processes. Then, as the nitty-gritty particulars of a project are ironed out, adjusting course and reviewing changes is a more straight forward process.

== Tight Feedback Loops
Agile helps tech writers verify doc quickly by creating tighter feedback loops through link:../reviews[SME and Peer Reviews] as part of the Definition of Done.
