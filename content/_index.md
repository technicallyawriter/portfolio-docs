# N. Parker Jones

Experienced tech writer (6+ years) with an emphasis on docs-as-code processes, Agile methodology, and
clear communication over jumbled jargon.

## Docs-as-code

I prefer to treat my docs like source code. Mirroring software development's processes instills rigorous habits and tight feedback loops, making it easier to produce modular, reviewed, and tested documentation at scale. 

<--->

## Agile methodology

Six years experience in an Agile environment with Sprint and Kanban approaches. Participated in and led daily stand-ups, Sprint Planning, Backlog Refinement, Retrospective, and Definition of Done meetings. 

<--->

## Attention to language

* Poynter ACES Certificate in Editing, 2021
* MA English, University of North Carolina at Wilmington, 2015
* BA English, University of North Carolina at Wilmington, 2011

## The perils of technical writing 

I enjoy working in the middle of this spectrum, preferrably not too far to the right, though! &#128540;

To one side of the starting point are examples that increasingly 'Solve problems,' such as 'Tools that don't need a manual.' In the other direction are a series of points that increasingly 'Create problems,' such as 'Tools that need a manual but don't have one' and 'Tools whose manual starts with 'How to read this manual''." >}}
