## Docs-as-code

I prefer to treat my docs like source code. Mirroring software development's processes instills rigorous habits and tight feedback loops, making it easier to produce modular, reviewed, and tested documentation at scale.

## Agile methodology

Six years experience in an Agile environment with Sprint and Kanban approaches. Participated in and led daily stand-ups, Sprint Planning, Backlog Refinement, Retrospective, and Definition of Done meetings.

## Attention to language

* MA English, University of North Carolina at Wilmington, 2015
* BA English, University of North Carolina at Wilmington, 2011

To one side of the starting point are examples that increasingly 'Solve problems,' such as 'Tools that don't need a manual.' In the other direction are a series of points that increasingly 'Create problems,' such as 'Tools that need a manual but don't have one' and 'Tools whose manual starts with 'How to read this manual''." >}}
